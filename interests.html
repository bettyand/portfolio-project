            <dt>Cats!</dt>
            <dd>I have 2 cats, Jasper and Felix, who are pictured above. I adopted them when they were about 4months
                old, and now they're almost 7 years old! They currently live in Raleigh with my parents, but when I am
                in a more long-term living situation they'll get to live with me again. I miss them terribly, and drive
                back to visit them (and my parents I guess) at least once a month.</dd>
            <dd>I have made friends with several cats who live in my new neighborhood in Charlotte, and hope to visit a
                cat cafe soon.</dd>
            <dt>Flight Rising</dt>
            <dd><a class="external" href="https://www1.flightrising.com/" target="_blank">Flight Rising</a> is
                dragon-themed pet sim browser game I have been playing since 2017. When I was furloughed due to COVID in
                2020/2021, I got involved in community-run events on the site to keep busy and make friends. The
                spreadsheet, bbcode, and organizational skills I learned in the process gave me the confidence to learn
                actual programming.</dd>
            <dt>Research</dt>
            <dd>I have always loved reading, and lately my focus has been on nonfiction. Here are some of my favorite
                topics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Philosophy/Religion/Mythology</li>
                    <li>Psychology/Neurology</li>
                    <li>Evolutionary Biology</li>
                    <li>And of course, cats!</li>
                </ul>
